# EDA_Bank_Telemarketing_Campaign
      This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on a bank telemarketing campaign dataset aimed at understanding customer response patterns and identifying areas for improvement in positive response rates.

## Dataset Description
      The dataset comprises information about customers contacted during a specific year for opening term deposit accounts. Each row represents a customer and includes various attributes such as age, salary, balance, marital status, contact method, duration of the call, etc. The target variable indicates whether the customer responded positively to the campaign.

## Attributes

- salary: Customer's salary
- balance: Bank account balance
- marital: Marital status of the customer
- targeted: Whether the customer was targeted
- default: Whether the customer has credit in default
- housing: Housing loan status
- loan: Personal loan status
- contact: Contact communication type
- day: Day of the month when the customer was contacted
- month: Month and year of the campaign

## Project Objective
      The primary objective of this project is to perform end-to-end EDA on the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. By analyzing various factors influencing the response rate, we aim to provide actionable recommendations to the bank on areas where they can focus their efforts to improve the effectiveness of future marketing campaigns.

## Files Included
- Bank+Marketing+Campaign_EDA-blank+notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA process and analysis.
